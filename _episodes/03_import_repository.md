Once Git is configured, we can start using it.

Our project for this lesson will be to create a repository to write our Data Management Plan. 

We can create repositories in many different ways. We could create a local repository in our computer, create a new repository in GitHub, or copy somebody's elses repository. Let's copy a repository. 

I have created a template repository in https://github.com/clarallebot/GRAD521_DMPtemplate that you will import to your account.

Sign in to https://www.github.com If you don't have an account, create one. 

Now click on the "+" icon, on the upper right, and select Import repository. Give it a name following this file naming convention: 

GRAD521_DMPSurname_2019 

where Surname is your surname. It will take a minute or two to be ready.

Explore the GitHub space. The first thing you will see is that there are two files in the repository: a README.md and an index.md These are markdown files. Markdown is a language to write formatted text that is very intuitive, and that is quite useful to work in GitHub, so we will use if for this lesson. The content of the README.md file is what you see 


You will see a tab named "branches". This repository has only one branch that, by default, is named "master". We will not go over branches during this introduction, it is too short. There is also a tab named "commits". A "commit" is a different version of the content in the repository. You can modify the files, and when you are done you submit the changes as commit. GitHub shows a lot of information about each commit:
* Date
* Author
*
