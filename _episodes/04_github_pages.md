You can use GitHub to host a website. This does not have much to do with version control 
at all, but it is a nice feature of GitHub that we will use in this particular project.

Locate the "Settings" tab in your project, and then navigate to GitHub pages. In this case, you imported the repository and this setting was already activated. If you had started the repository from scratch you would have needed to activate it.
