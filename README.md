==========

This lesson is a modification of the [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) lesson developed by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/). The official version is longer, covers more concepts, and in more detail, so take a look if you are interested in learning more. 

This lesson is being taught as part of the GRAD521 Research Data Management class at Oregon State University, and has been modified from the Software Carpentry version by Clara Llebot.
